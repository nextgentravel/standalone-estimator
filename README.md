## ðŸŒŽ Quick start

1.  **Setting up your dev machine.**

    - Clone this repository to your local machine
    - Install Gatsby CLI on your development machine `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd travel-guidebook-client/
    yarn
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `travel-guidebook-client` directory in your code editor of choice and edits in the `src` directory. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **Running tests**

    You can run a11y integration tests by running the command `yarn run test:e2e`.  When the Chrome browser appears, click on "accessibility.test.js" under "Integration Tests" and observe the test running.  Any exceptions will be raised.  These same tests run via github actions when a pull request is made.

1.  **Deployments**

    Deployments are made when a pull request passes all testing and review and is merged into the staging or master (production) branch.
