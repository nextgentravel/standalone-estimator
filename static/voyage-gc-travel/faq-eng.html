                            <p class="mrgn-tp-md">A blanket travel authority (BTA) is a continuous or repetitive travel  authorization. BTAs have no variation in the specific terms and conditions of  trips where it is not practical to get approval from the employer for each  individual trip. Any exceptions to the BTA parameters require that the  individual trip be specifically pre-approved where possible. BTAs do not apply  to groups of employees. Employees may have more than 1 BTA simultaneously.</p>
                            <p>The BTA is valid for 1 fiscal year and should be renewed every  year.</p>
                            <p>When booking travel in the AmexGBT travel management solution, you  can select the blanket travel authority option from a drop-down menu in the  Accounting/Payment details page for travellers who have a BTA. The travel  request will be approved automatically. </p>
                            <p>Please note there are no BTAs for travelling as a non-public  servant.</p>
                            <p>BTA approval depends on the departmental delegation of  authority. Please contact the designated departmental travel coordinator or  your departmental financial policy group for more information.</p>

                              <p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Departments without the EMT in the AmexGBT  travel management solution can only create travel requests with an offline TAN.  Therefore, all approval is offline. There is no need for a BTA in the AmexGBT travel  management solution as it is out of scope for those departments. Travellers from  those departments should contact their SFTO for the specific departmental  procedures for BTAs.</p>
