| |   * **Training** – to improve and strengthen your skills
| |   * **Other**
| | - **Traveller** – Is the traveller a public servant or non-public servant (only applicable if you are booking travel for other travellers other than yourself)
| | - **Virtual presence or remote meeting solutions** – Provide your reasoning for why the activities could not be conducted using virtual tools such as Webex or Skype
| | - **Number of travellers** – The number of travellers that will be going

| | ### Getting preliminary approval
| |
| | - Once you’ve created your estimate, submit to your approver who is usually a senior manager. Your supervisor or organizational chart can help you find them
| | - Ensure that you give the approver enough time to approve your trip before your travel date. Somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks should be sufficient
| | - Once you’ve gotten your approval, you may go ahead and book your trip
