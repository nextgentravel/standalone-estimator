| |### *Getting preliminary approval*  
| |
| |Once you’ve created your estimate, submit to your approver who is usually a senior manager. Your supervisor or organizational chart can help you find them  
| |
| |Ensure that you give the approver enough time to approve your trip before your travel date. Somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks should be sufficient  
| |
| |Once you’ve gotten your approval, you may go ahead and book your trip
