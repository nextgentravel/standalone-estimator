| | ### Getting preliminary approval
| |
| | - Once you’ve created your estimate, submit to your approver who is usually a senior manager. Your supervisor or organizational chart can help you find them
| | - Ensure that you give the approver enough time to approve your trip before your travel date. Somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks should be sufficient
| | - Once you’ve gotten your approval, you may go ahead and book your trip

| | ### Booking your trip
| | - Using your Travel Identification Number (TIN) [log into the system](https://isuite6.hrgworldwide.com/gcportal/en-ca/sts.aspx)
| | - In the system, use the instructions to book your trip. You can reference your estimates listed above to go through the booking process. [Link to the HRG instructions](/en/booktravel)
| | - When at the submitting stage, requesting for online approval, try to submit at a time where the approver can approve it immediately. Success rates for bookings are over 90% if requests are immediately approved. Delaying submissions can cause the process to fail, causing you to restart the online booking process.
