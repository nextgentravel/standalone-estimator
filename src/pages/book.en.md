### 5. Book your hotel

Hotel accommodations can be searched and booked through the HRG system with pre-negotiated rates. Booking through HRG is a great option for a fast and simple solution to find and book a hotel that is within policy. To find out what policy allows, [use this tool](/en/rates/).
​

​
**Tip:** when beginning your search, it may be a good idea to call the hotel directly and speak to a booking member. Be sure to ask about any applicable discounted rates or offers for federal employees which you may be eligible for that are not included in HRG.

If you chose to book private accommodations instead, please include this in the Expense Management Tool as an Out-of-Pocket expense. Do keep in mind that private accommodations are still subject to [NJC policy under Appendix D](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/app_d/en). 

Follow section *5. Book Hotel* of these [Creating a travel request instructions](https://hrg.exceedlms.com/student/activity/220776-en-ug-creating-a-travel-request) to start booking your hotel.</div>

### 7. Adding additional estimates

Before your trip is finalized, you must first add all other additional estimates to your Travel Request so that your Approver may view an accurate cost estimate of your trip.


To add additional estimates, use the [Creating a Travel Request training guide](https://hrg.exceedlms.com/student/activity/220776-en-ug-creating-a-travel-request) and locate the section Access the Travel Request in the EMT (Expense Management Tool).

#### Meals, incidentals & private accommodation

To include expenses for meals, incidentals and private accommodations expenses within HRG go to the [Creating a Travel Request training guide](https://hrg.exceedlms.com/student/activity/220776-en-ug-creating-a-travel-request) and locate the section Add Meals, Incidentals and Private Accomodations.

**Note:** if you are not responsible to pay for one or more meals during your time away, please do not include it as an expense. For example: meals that would be included in the airfare or if you are a guest at an event that is providing food.

#### Out-of-pocket expenses
For more information related to specific out-of-pocket expenses, please refer to Part III - Travel Modules of the [NJC Travel Directive](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/d10/v238/en).

### 8. Submit for approval

Notify your Supervisor or approver before you submit your travel request, if it is possible. Success rates for bookings are much higher if requests are immediately approved. Delayed approvals can result in having to restart the booking process as rates may fluctuate. </div>

### FAQ

**1. What happens if the cost of my trip exceeds my previously approved trip estimate?**


**2. Can I book transportation or accomodation outside of HRG?**

No.  You must book transporation or accomodation within the HRG system or by contacting HRG directly.

As an exception, you must book train tickets and car rentals outside of HRG for international travel. 

**3. Can I book a hotel which falls outside of policy?**

Yes.  It is possible to book a hotel which is above your city rate limit, as there are many external factors which could contribute to an increased hotel cost. In these cases, a justification for exceeding the city rate limit is needed to get your hotel choice approved.

**4. Are ACRD car rental rates applicable for internationanl travel?**

No.  ACRD car rental rates are only applicable to domestic travel.</div>
