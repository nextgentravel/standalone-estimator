### Booking Transportation
The Government of Canada mandates that you take the most economical means of travel. Depending on your destination and distance to travel, you may choose between air, rail, or car for your trip
​
#### Booking Flights
Air travel can be booked directly through the HRG travel system. Many users, however, choose to begin their flight search on other booking platforms. Wherever you choose to search for flights, booking them in HRG helps for a faster and more simple approval
​
#### Booking Car Rentals
If you choose to book a car, please visit the Accommodation and Car Rental Directory (ACRD). To find an approved car rental company in cities across Canada that has your desired vehicle type, please view the car search page. The ACRD also provides you with pre-negotiated rates that you can expect to pay at your city of destination.

**Note:** Car rentals with ACRD rates are only for domestic trips. If travelling abroad, you can book a car rental via a local company. Please do remember to keep all receipts related to your travel
​
#### Booking Rail
Domestic rail travel can be booked on HRG, however, when travelling abroad you must book train tickets outside of the system. Please do remember to keep all receipts related to your travel

#### Booking Accommodations
Hotel accommodations can be searched and booked through the HRG system with pre-negotiated rates. Booking through HRG is a great option for a fast and simple solution to find and book a hotel that is within policy. To find out what policy allows, [use this tool](https://blue-dune-0a7b2b910.azurestaticapps.net/en/rates/)
​

It is possible to book a hotel which is above your city rate limit, as there are many external factors which could contribute to an increased hotel cost. In these cases, a justification for exceeding the city rate limit is needed to get your hotel choice approved

​
**Tip:** when beginning your search, it may be a good idea to call the hotel directly and speak to a booking member. Be sure to ask about any applicable discounted rates or offers for federal employees which you may be eligible for that are not included in HRG

​
If you chose to book private accommodations instead, please include this in the Expense Management Tool as an Out-of Pocket expense. Do keep in mind that private accommodations are still subject to the same city rate limits as hotels booked through the system


#### Payment methods
Transportation: the Departmental Travel Expense Card (DTEC) should appear as the payment method
Hotel and car rental: you must use your Individual Designated Travel Card (IDTC) or your personal credit card. However, the IDTC card is the preferred method of payment

### Adding additional estimates

Before your trip is finalized, you must first add all other additional estimates to your Travel Request so that your Approver may view an accurate cost estimate of your trip.



To add additional estimates, [use this training guide](https://exceed-primary-production-main.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/resource_pdfs/targets/1178629/original/en-ug-creating-a-travel-request-19jul2019.pdf?response-cache-control=private%2C%20max-age%3D0&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3Den-ug-creating-a-travel-request-19jul2019.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJXIVQ57FEF3S4FFA%2F20200826%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200826T132450Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8f1506c0069b4191e70f18c2623e2a05181d3c7fcc3f2d483f067a308fd6a9ae) and locate the section on the Expense Management Tool (EMT)

### Meals, Incidentals & Private Accommodation

To find your meals, and incidentals allowance refer to the Rates and Limits calculator. For private accommodations and specific meals and incidental daily rates please refer to  [Appendix C of the NJC](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/d10/v238/s659/en)

**Note:** if you are not responsible to pay for one or more meals during your time away, please do not include it as an expense. For example: meals that would be included in the airfare or if you are a guest at an event that is providing food

### Submit for approval

When at the submitting stage, requesting for online approval, try to submit at a time where the approver can approve it immediately. Success rates for bookings are much higher if requests are immediately approved. Delaying submissions can cause the process to fail, causing you to restart the online booking process
