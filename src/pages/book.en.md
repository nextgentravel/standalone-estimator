### Booking Transportation
The Government of Canada mandates that you take the most economical means of travel. Depending on your destination and distance to travel, you may choose between air, rail, or car for your trip.
​
#### Booking Flights
Air travel can be booked directly through the HRG travel system. Many users, however, choose to begin their flight search on other booking platforms. Wherever you choose to search for flights, booking them in HRG helps for a faster and more simple approval.
​
#### Booking Car Rentals
You can book your car rental through HRG or through the Accommodation and Car Rental Directory (ACRD).  To find an approved car rental company in cities across Canada that has your desired vehicle type, please view the [Search for car](https://rehelv-acrd.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ACRDS/rechercher-search-4-eng.aspx) page. The ACRD also provides you with pre-negotiated rates that you can expect to pay at your city of destination.

**Note:** Car rentals with ACRD rates are only for domestic trips. If travelling abroad, you can book a car rental via a local company. Please do remember to keep all receipts related to your travel.
​
#### Booking Rail
Domestic rail travel can be booked on HRG, however, when travelling abroad you must book train tickets outside of the system. Please do remember to keep all receipts related to your travel.

### Booking Accommodations
Hotel accommodations can be searched and booked through the HRG system with pre-negotiated rates. Booking through HRG is a great option for a fast and simple solution to find and book a hotel that is within policy. To find out what policy allows, [use this tool](/en/rates/).
​

It is possible to book a hotel which is above your city rate limit, as there are many external factors which could contribute to an increased hotel cost. In these cases, a justification for exceeding the city rate limit is needed to get your hotel choice approved.

​
**Tip:** when beginning your search, it may be a good idea to call the hotel directly and speak to a booking member. Be sure to ask about any applicable discounted rates or offers for federal employees which you may be eligible for that are not included in HRG.

If you chose to book private accommodations instead, please include this in the Expense Management Tool as an Out-of-Pocket expense. Do keep in mind that private accommodations are still subject to [NJC policy under Appendix D](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/app_d/en).

### Adding additional estimates

Before your trip is finalized, you must first add all other additional estimates to your Travel Request so that your Approver may view an accurate cost estimate of your trip.


To add additional estimates, use the [Creating a Travel Request training guide](https://hrg.exceedlms.com/student/activity/220776-en-ug-creating-a-travel-request) and locate the section Access the Travel Request in the EMT (Expense Management Tool).

#### Out-of-pocket expenses
For more information related to specific out-of-pocket expenses, please refer to Part III - Travel Modules of the [NJC Travel Directive](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/d10/v238/en).

### Meals, incidentals & private accommodation

To include expenses for meals, incidentals and private accommodations expenses within HRG go to the [Creating a Travel Request training guide](https://hrg.exceedlms.com/student/activity/220776-en-ug-creating-a-travel-request) and locate the section Add Meals, Incidentals and Private Accomodations.

**Note:** if you are not responsible to pay for one or more meals during your time away, please do not include it as an expense. For example: meals that would be included in the airfare or if you are a guest at an event that is providing food.

### Submit for approval

When at the submitting stage, requesting for online approval, try to submit at a time where the approver can approve it immediately. Success rates for bookings are much higher if requests are immediately approved. Delaying submissions can cause the process to fail, causing you to restart the online booking process.
