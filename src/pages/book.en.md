### Booking Tool 

To book and manage your trip you need an account for HRG, the official travel booking system for most Government of Canada departments. If you do not have an account, create one by [clicking here](https://isuite6.hrgworldwide.com/Portals/6/docs/EN%20-%20UG%20-%20Registering%20for%20the%20Portal-19jul2019.pdf).
Once you have logged in to HRG, follow [these steps](https://isuite6.hrgworldwide.com/Portals/6/ENG%20FULL%20-%20Available%20resources%20for%20travellers%20and%20travel%20arrangers_.pdf) to book your trip. You can use the estimates that you previously created as a reference. 

**Tip:** the best time to submit your booking request is during business hours or at a time when your approver is available to approve your trip. Due to fluctuating prices, if your booking request is not approved quickly you may need to start all over again.

### Transportation
The Government of Canada mandates that you take the most economical means of travel to your destination. This means that depending on your destination and distance you may choose between air, rail, and car travel for your trip. Hereâ€™s what you need to know for each type of transportation:

#### Flights
Air travel can be booked directly through  the HRG travel system. Many users, however, choose to begin their flight search on other booking platforms. Wherever you choose to search for flights book them in HRG for faster and simpler approval. 

#### Trains
Rail travel within Canada can be booked on HRG, however, when travelling abroad you must book train tickets through one of the local train companies.  If you book train tickets outside the HRG platform, remember to keep all  your receipts. 

#### Car Rental
If you will be driving, use the [Accommodation and Car Rental Directory](https://rehelv-acrd.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/acrds/index-eng.aspx) (ACRD) to find an approved car rental company in cities across Canada. The ACRD also provides you with pre-negotiated rates that you can expect to pay at your city of destination. When travelling outside of Canada, find a reputable vendor at your destination and keep all your receipts.
