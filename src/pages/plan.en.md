### Create your estimate

After deciding to travel, you should start by creating an estimate. The estimate provides an overall approximation of what the total cost of the trip will be to your approver in order to approve your travel request. Estimate the cost of your trip by clicking the Trip Estimator

### Getting preliminary approval

Once you’ve created your estimate, submit to your approver who is usually a senior manager. You can identify your approver by speaking with your supervisor or referring to your organizational chart.

Your approver will review your travel proposal and sign off. Let them know when your trip is, and how urgent your request is. Ensure that you give the approver enough time to approve your trip before your travel date. Between 3 to 4 weeks should be a sufficient time frame.

Once you’ve gotten your approval, you may go ahead and book your trip
