### 1. Get preliminary approval

You will need preliminary approval from your Supervisor before you can book your trip.  To get this approval you must create and submit a *Travel Estimate* and have your supervisor approve it.

Our **Trip Estimator** will help you create an estimate and send it to your supervisor.

**Note:** Allow 3-4 weeks for your Supervisor to approve your estimate.  For urgent travel, contact your Supervisor directly and inform themt when you're submitting your estimate for approval.

### 2. Get things ready

Before you can book your trip, make sure you have the following items ready:

1. Valid personal identification (e.g. passort, drivers licence)

**Would you prefer to pay using a government credit card?**

​
You can apply for an *Individual Designated Travel Card (ITDC)*, commonly referred to as a Government Card.  ITDC offers a variety of perks from insurance to extending your interest free payment window.  To find out more about what an IDTC can do for you, please visit the [*IDTC knowledge base page*](/en/knowledgebase/idtc).
​

**Tip:** schedule up to 6 weeks in advance if signing up for these cards in order to receive them in time to travel.
