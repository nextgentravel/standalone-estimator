### Create an Estimate

You will need to estimate the cost of your trip to get approved to travel and to include your trip in your department's travel plan. To make this process easier we have created a Trip Estimator. Click on the link to create and submit your travel estimate.

### Get Preliminary Approval
Plan ahead and provide your approver 3 to 4 weeks to approve your travel estimate. Once you have approval you can go ahead and book your trip. 

Donâ€™t know who needs to approve your estimate? See [PSPC Organization Chart](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/apropos-about/org-eng.html).
