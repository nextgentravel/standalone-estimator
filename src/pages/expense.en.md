### Create an expense report

Before expensing your trip, it is important to first verify payment methods are setup correctly.

To report and request reimbursement for the expenses incurred during your business travel, please locate your Travel Request in HRG and follow [this guide to create an expense report](https://hrg.exceedlms.com/student/activity/220777-creating-an-expense-report-ug).
​

It is important to file your expenses as soon as possible, with as much detail as needed so that you can be reimbursed quickly.


Please contact the finance team if you are having any trouble with expensing.

​
**Note:** If you have chosen to use your Individual Designated Travel Card (IDTC) as your payment method, you will be allowed a larger pay window without interest. However, after 30 days there will be a suspension of cash withdrawal privileges.
