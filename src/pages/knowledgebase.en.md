### Blanket travel authority

**Please read carefully**

This only applies to authorization for travel that is ongoing or repetitive in nature, with the same purpose and accommodation requirements. (This is issued for cases that are not practical or efficient to obtain approval from the employer for each trip). Your employer will advise if authorization is approved for blanket travel.  https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/d10/v238/s651/en
​
### Naming your Travel
When naming your trip, please ensure that the name is unique and distinguishable to avoid confusion later on. It is always suggested to include the date of the trip and the location in the trip name
​
### Travel Access Number (TAN)
Travel Access Number or TAN is a number that is associated with your branch or department
​
### Modifying a Financial Code Block (FCB)
The financial code blocks are assigned by default based on the information inputted when creating the traveller profile. However, it may be necessary to change this information if an expense should be submitted to a different cost center. Additionally it may be necessary to split a Coding Line between multiple cost centres, should more than one cost centre be responsible for your travel
​
​
### Checking the status of your request
If your request has been:
- approved: you should receive an email of confirmation. As well within a couple of days, you should receive a financial email about funds being transferred to your account as indicated by your travel request. Within HRG itself a green check should appear beside your travel request
​
- returned / rejected: if your request has been rejected, you should then receive an email providing you with a link to modify your travel. If you do not receive an email, go into the travel request in HRG or review your hotel booking. Either option should appear as canceled or not booked. Please check with your approver if you are unsure of what to modify to get your travel request approved
​

### Unsubmit or Modify a Travel Request
Within HRG it is possible to unsubmit a travel request on the Travel Request page. By unsubmitting the request will be recalled from the approver and will be available for you to modify <br>
**Note:** a Travel Request can only be unsubmitted or recalled if it has not yet been approved
​
### Verify or Modify the Approver
It is always good practice to verify that the approver is correct before submitting your travel request. This can be done by locating your trip in the Expense Management link from the dropdown. Within the approval tab you can view your current approver or select a new one based on the list within the system <br>
**Note:** if the name of your desired approver does not appear from the dropdown, please contact your Help Desk or System Administrator
​
### Verify or Modify a Recommender
It is always good practice to also verify that the recommender is correct before submitting your travel request. This can be done by locating your trip in the Expense Management link from the dropdown. Within the approval tab you can view your current Recommender and or set an Alternative Recommender from the list in the system <br>
When an alternate Recommender is set, please remember to remove any Recommender who you do not wish to have included <br>
**Note:** when more than one Recommender is required, add the name of the first Recommender on the list. It is the responsibility of the Recommender to add any additional recommenders to the approval process if it is required
