| |
| |**Please read carefully**

| |This only applies to authorization for travel that is ongoing or repetitive in nature, with the same purpose and accommodation requirements. (This is issued for cases that are not practical or efficient to obtain approval from the employer for each trip). Your employer will advise if authorization is approved for blanket travel. [Look here for more information](https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/d10/v238/s651/en)
