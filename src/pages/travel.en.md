### Things to Remember
1. **Save all receipts for items that you wish to expense.**  Meals receipts are not needed however, as you will be reimbursed per meal with, or without a receipt, based on your bookings within HRG.

2. **Keep track of your time travelled.** Based on the hours you spend during travel, you may be entitled to claim overtime.

3. **You have travel insurance when travelling under work status.**  Insurance is provided via various insurance boards and provides coverage to the employee as well accompanying spouse and children.  You will also receive insurance from your Individual Designated Travel Card (IDTC).
